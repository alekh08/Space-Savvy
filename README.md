# **Space Savvy**  
**Interactive Visualization of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)**



## **Project Overview**
**Space Savvy** is a web application designed to visualize the orbits of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), such as asteroids and comets, in an interactive 3D environment. It provides real-time data about NEOs, including their trajectories, size, speed, and potential impact risks. By integrating NASA’s NEO API, this project aims to raise public awareness about these objects and their implications for Earth.

### **Key Features**
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Real-time simulation of NEO orbits using Three.js.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches live NEO data from NASA’s API, providing detailed information on each object.
- **Potential Impact Alerts**: Notifications when an NEO is on a potentially hazardous course.
- **Educational Resources**: Information on NEOs, their characteristics, and their impact on Earth.
